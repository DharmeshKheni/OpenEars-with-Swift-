/**This takes an NSString which is the word or phrase you want to say, and the OEFliteVoice to use to say the phrase.
Usage Example:
 \verbatim
 [self.fliteController say:@"Say it, don't spray it." withVoice:self.slt];
 \endverbatim
 There are a total of nine FliteVoices available for use with OpenEars. The Slt voice is the most popular one and it ships with OpenEars. The other eight voices can be downloaded as part of the OpenEarsExtras package available at the URL <a href="http://bitbucket.org/Politepix/openearsextras">http://bitbucket.org/Politepix/openearsextras</a>. To use them, just drag the desired downloaded voice's framework into your app, import its header at the top of your calling class (e.g. import &lt;Slt/Slt.h&gt; or import &lt;Rms/Rms.h&gt;) and instantiate it as you would any other object, then passing the instantiated voice to this method.
